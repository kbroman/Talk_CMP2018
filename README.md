## Steps toward reproducible research

These are slides for a presentation on reproducible research for the
[Cellular & Molecular Pathology Graduate Program](http://cmp.wisc.edu)
at UW-Madison on 29 Nov 2018.

This is a remix of [my usual reproducible research
talk](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_ReproRes), a talk I gave on
[data management](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_DataMgmt), and
a 1-hour [Workshop on Reproducible
Research](https://github.com/kbroman/RR_Workshop).
